Pairwise Sequence Alignment using Hidden Markov Models

This project explores the alignment of HIV sequences through the application of Hidden Markov Models.
The model parameters are determined using the Baum-Welch algorithm, while sequence alignment is generated using the Viterbi algorithm.
The obtained results are compared with those generated by the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which produces globally optimal sequence alignments.
